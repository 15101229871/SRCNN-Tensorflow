# SRCNN-Tensorflow
Tensorflow implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks for super-resolution. The original Matlab and Caffe from official website can be found {here}. [http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html]

## Prerequisites
This code requires Tensorflow. Also scipy is used instead of Matlab or OpenCV. Especially, installing OpenCV at Linux is sort of complicated. So, with reproducing this paper, I used scipy instead. For more imformation about scipy, click {here}. [https://www.scipy.org/]
